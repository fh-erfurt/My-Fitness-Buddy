<summary> ### project description </summary>
<br>

During the 5th semester, an Andorid app was developed as part of the PME course.
There were the following requirements for the project:
- Minimum Android version: Marshmallow 6.0 (API level 23) - higher version also welcome
- Use of AndroidX / Jetpack strongly recommended
- Focus UI / User Interaction
- Required content:
  * Activity + Fragments
  * Navigation menu (e.g. Drawer, Dashboard, Swipe or ...)
  * List view (keyword: Recycler View)
  * Detail view for element of the list view
  * Options menu (e.g. for multiple selection in the list view or actions for the detail view)
  * Form/Input Screen
  * Can be used in portrait as well as in landscape mode
  * Code documentation in English not forgotten!
  * Optional: Unit Test / Automated UI Tests

* Classic example for above criteria: Contact management

Until 20.03.2021 the app was developed by our team and will be used and developed privately afterwards.

- profile
- training plans
- exercises
- analysis
- settings

## functions
- create/modify/delete exercises
    * name
    * description
    * muscle group

- create/modify/delete training plans
    * name
    * type
- logging of repetitions and weights in the exercises
- update weight and read BMI
- weight history
- dark mode
- all views with landscape mode

## further development
The app is not final and will be further developed for private use.
Construction sites would be here:
- expand analysis (BMI, Gender, etc. )
- more training categories (Running training, etc. )
- extend database to allow more functions
- Interface to icon selection page
- presentation of the description for optimal exercise flow
